# Push Notifications on OpenSource SocialNetwork

Using the OneSignal API, this component allows users to decide if they want to receive notifications on their computer or mobile device for interactions on their posts, friendship requests, or received messages after some time away from the site. The notifications are displayed in the default language of the user's device, with translations required.

The administrator can use the OneSignal Dashboard to send messages to all users who have accepted to receive notifications. The administrator can also set the following:

- The number of times a page is viewed/loaded on the screen before the notification prompt appears;
- The amount of time spent on a single page before the prompt appears;
- Whether the system will send notifications for received messages and the amount of time away;
- The customization of the appearance of the OneSignal bell.

To create the authorization ID in OneSignal, after create an account on that site, go to the https://dashboard.onesignal.com/apps, click on **new app/website**, then fill name and select web and click on **Next**. To finish the process, [follow this instructions](https://documentation.onesignal.com/v7.0/docs/web-push-custom-code-setup).

Note that using this component may incur additional costs. Please see the pricing table at https://onesignal.com/pricing for more information.
